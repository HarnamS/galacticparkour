Game Description for Galactic Parkour
Goals: 
In Galactic Parkour, you must navigate 9 deadly laser-filled levels and reach the exit, which is a portal, as fast as possible. You play as a little stranded alien in the endless void of space, where each level represents a different part of the hazardous terrain you're trying to escape.

Every stage is filled with many dangers, such as laser turrets, air bombs, and the chance of falling. Your objective is not just to survive, but to master each stage’s layout and reach the portal before your time bonus gets removed. The portal is your only way out; reaching it safely marks the end of the stage and gives you a score based on how fast you got there. When you reach the portals of all 9 levels, then you can see how fast you truly are. 

When changing the difficulty from easy to medium, or even hard, your obstacles increase as you now face air bombs and constant shooting lasers. Once you have mastered all the stages, your final goal is to beat them all on hard and without dying, as fast as possible. 

Rules: 
There are a few clear rules in my game that every alien must follow:
Avoid Lasers: Automated laser guns are placed on each stage. If a laser hits you, your character explodes and respawns at the beginning of the stage.
Use Platforms Wisely: You can land and jump from floating platforms. They are your key to navigating obstacles and gaining height.
Jump Pads: Special pads give your jumps an explosive boost. Use them to reach high or far-off platforms.
Bomb Hazards (Medium/Hard only): Floating air bombs spawn during higher difficulties. If they collide with you, you explode.
Death: Dying resets your position. Your score for the level won’t increase until you survive and reach the portal.
